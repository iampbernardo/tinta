      <h1 id="headings">h1 heading title</h1>
      <p>The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.</p>

      <p>You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back. It's admirable, but mistaken.</p>

      <p>You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.</p>


      <h2>h2 heading</h2>
      <p>Do you feel in charge?</p>

      <p>Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.</p>


      <h3>h3 heading</h3>
      <p>Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.</p>

      <p>Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?</p>


      <h4>h4 heading</h4>
      <p>I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.</p>


      <h5>h5 heading</h5>
      <p>Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would sit there and order a <a href="#">Fernet Branca</a>. I had this fantasy, that I would look across the tables and I would see you there with a wife  <strong>maybe a couple of kids</strong>. You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you. But we would both know that you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that. I still do.</p>

      <h6>h6 heading</h6>
      <p>No guns, no killing.</p>

      <p><a href="#">Speak of the devil</a>, and he shall appear.</p>

      <p>I know why you choose to <mark>have your little, ahem... group-therapy</mark> sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.</p>
      <p>It's simple. We, uh, <del>kill the Batman</del>.</p>
